* (New) Find-my-Friends (FmF) tracking method to locate devices with the iCloud Location Services if you have 2fa on your iCloud account.
* (New) Family Sharing (FamShr) tracking method to locate devices with the iCloud Location Services if you do not have 2fa on your iCloud account.
* (New) Integration with the Home Assistant Companion App version 2
* (New) Use either HA iOS App version 1, version 2 or both on the same device_tracker platform.
* (New) iCloud3 Event log Lovelace custom card.
* (Updated) Additional attributes & sensors
* (New) Customize the list of sensors that are created by iCloud3.
* (New) Track devices from multiple zones.
* (New) The iCloud3 documentation has been updated and reorganized to make it easier to reference.
* (New) Display debug information related to processing the device's location data reported by the iCloud Location Services and the HA iOS App. This data can also be displayed in the iCloud3 Event Log Card.

### General Description of the iCloud3 Device Tracker Custom Component

iCloud3 is a device_tracker custom_component for iPhones, iPads and iWatches. It is tightly integrated with the HA IOS App, uses the Waze Route Tracker for distance and time information, creates Dynamic Stationary Zones when you are stationary, supports device include/exclude filters, minimizes  battery usage, and much more.

- View the extensive user documentation with examples of presence detection, including sample configuration files, on the  [iCloud3 Github Repository](https://github.com/gcobb321/icloud3).
- Download it from the [iCloud3 Github Repository Releases Section](https://github.com/gcobb321/icloud3/releases).

iCloud3 is a Home Assistant device tracker custom component that greatly expands the capabilities of the iCloud (and iCloud2) HA component. It exposes many new attributes, provides many new features, is based on enhanced route tracking methods, is much more accurate, and includes additional service calls.

Some of these features include:
* A variable polling interval based on the Waze route mapping service (drive time and distance rather than just a calculated straight line distance).
*  Immediate status update on zone change notification from the bridge IOS App. (enter and exit).
*  Sensor templates that are used in automations, in scripts and on Lovelace cards are created and updated automatically. 
*  GPS wandering that changes the device's state from home to not_home randomly is eliminated. 
* Abilitity to track your location from multiple zones.
*  Short 15-second polling when less than 1 mi/km from home (reliably trigger automations based on an accurate distance).
*  Ability to include or exclude devices or device types (filters for devices you want to track).
*  Dynamic Stationary Zones (conserve battery life when stationary).
*  Old location data and GPS accuracy are automatically discarded. 
*  Additional service call commands (setting intervals, pausing and resuming polling, zone assignment, etc.)
*  No longer need any other program (other than the HA IOS v1 or v2 app) to handle device tracking and presence detection (no more Nmap, OwnTracks or router based tracking components).
*  Many new configuration variables, attributes, sensors and Service Calls. A geekster stastic: The lines of code went from 425 to 6500+.
*  And more...
