### HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

HACS is a custom component that monitors update to other custom components, Lovelace custom cards, etc. iCloud3 will be listed on the store shortly. However, additional repositories can be added under the settings window and those repositories will also be monitored. The iCloud3 repository is structured to support HACS usage. To add iCloud3:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Add `gcobb321/icloud3` to the Add Custom Repository field.
3. Select `Integration` in the Type list.
4. Click the Save icon.   

Installation instructions and all of the documentation for HACS is found [here](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs).
