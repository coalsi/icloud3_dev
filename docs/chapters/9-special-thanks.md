# Special Thanks


I want to thank Walt Howd, (iCloud2 fame) who inspired me to tackle this project. I also want to give a shout out to Kovács Bálint, Budapest, Hungary who wrote the Python WazeRouteCalculator and some awesome HA guys (Petro31, scop, tsvi, troykellt, balloob, Myrddyn1, mountainsandcode,  diraimondo, fabaff, squirtbrnr, and mhhbob) who gave me the idea of using Waze in iCloud3.
